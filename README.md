[Windows](https://github.com/Deathemonic/BA-MU/releases/latest/download/BA-MU-win-x64.zip) | [Linux](https://github.com/Deathemonic/BA-MU/releases/latest/download/BA-MU-linux-x64.zip) | [MacOS](https://github.com/Deathemonic/BA-MU/releases/latest/download/BA-MU-osx-arm64.zip)

## Usage

BA-MU automates the process of transferring modifications from a modded AssetBundle to an original (or "patch") AssetBundle. This is useful for updating mods when a game receives a new patch.

The process works as follows:
1.  **Compare:** The tool identifies assets that exist in both the `--modded` and `--patch` bundles by matching their names and types.
2.  **Export:** Matched assets from the `--modded` bundle are exported to a `Dumps` folder.
    -   `Texture2D` assets are saved as images (`.tga` or `.png`).
    -   `TextAsset` assets are saved as data files (`.txt` or `.bytes`).
    -   All other asset types are saved as structured `.json` files.
3.  **Import:** The exported files are then read, and their data is used to overwrite the corresponding assets in the `--patch` bundle.
4.  **Save:** A new, modified AssetBundle is saved in the `Modded` folder, containing the original patch content updated with your mods.

### Basic Example

```shell
bamu --modded your_modded.bundle --patch game_asset.bundle
```

This command will find matching assets, export the modified ones from `your_modded.bundle`, and import them into `game_asset.bundle`, saving the result in a new bundle inside the `Modded` directory.
